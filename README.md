# 🐏 Ali Sheep Road 🐏

**Ali Sheep**, artist and founder, invites you to walk with him along **Sheep Road** — a collective creative trail, open to all, where each contribution weaves the web of gentle sweet rebellion.

Welcome to **Alisheeproad**, a soft, spicy community art project.
In the spirit of a Little Prince who demands to be drawn a sheep, Alisheeproad invites you to forge your own path of wool — a path of self-mockery, gentle criticism and liberating imagination. 

**Ali Sheep replies to the Little Prince by unraveling his black yarn into lines of soft resistance.**

The Sheeproad is yours. See you on the road!

## 🎯 Purpose

Ali Sheep Road is an **autonomous, horizontal, and evolving** artistic space.  
Anyone can join the thread, leave, and return, leaving traces along the way.  
The project lives at the rhythm of the collective and the flow of creation.

We move **without masters, but with a compass and rules**.  
If you’re here, you’re already part of the weaving.

- To create visual and editorial works (drawings, AI images, zines, texts…)
- To explore soft, horizontal, distributed organization
- To leave a living trace — slow, tender, and outside the noise

## 📖 The Manifesto

> **Create slowly in a rushed world.**  
> **Listen instead of convincing.**  
> **Make care a radical act.**  
> **Ali Sheep Road is a thread that prefers horizontality over hierarchy.**

## 📌 How to Participate?

You can contribute in various ways:  
✨ Start a project → [MISSIONS/](./MISSIONS/)  

🧵 Engage with an active thread → [ROLES.md](./ROLES.md)

No pressure. You can **observe**, **pause**, **return later**, or simply exist in the space.

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

We have set **ethical and protective measures** to secure the collective:  
- [PROTECTION.md](./PROTECTION.md) — Member security and guidelines  
- [LIMITS.md](./LIMITS.md) — Boundaries of the project  

Ali Sheep Road is structured but fluid, open but mindful, artistic but concrete.

**Alisheeproad is a participatory art project initiated around Ali Sheep — an artist of the black flock.**  
Together, we create differently: softly, freely, collectively. Through creative missions, visual works, zines, and poetic acts of rebellion.

## 🎯 Our purpose

- To create visual and editorial works (drawings, AI images, zines, texts…)
- To explore soft, horizontal, distributed organization
- To leave a living trace — slow, tender, and outside the noise

## 🧶 What you can do

- **Join a creative mission** → check the `missions/` folder
- **Submit a creation** → add it to `creations/` with an image and short text (if you like)
- **Propose ideas, themes, missions, or structures**
- **Contribute** via translation, editing, design, reflection…
- **Help support and sell artworks**, or share the world of the project

## 🐑 How it works

- Everything is documented in this repository
- There are open roles you can embody (`ROLES.md`)
- A private encrypted space exists for quiet conversations (see `COMMUNITY.md`)

## 💸 About sales
